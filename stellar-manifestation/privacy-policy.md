## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Profile Data  
- **Birth Details**: When you create a profile, you provide your name, date of birth, time of birth, and location of birth.  
- **Optional Label**: Any custom label you assign to distinguish multiple profiles.  

_All birth details are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted or stored on external servers._

### 1.2 Usage & Analytics Data  
- We collect **anonymous** analytics events (screen views, button taps, feature usage) via Firebase Analytics to understand how the app is used and to improve features.  
- **No personally identifiable information** (PII) is associated with these analytics events.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

- **Generate Personalized Charts & Playlists**: Your birth details power the in-app computation of nakshatras and rāga recommendations.  
- **Schedule Reminders**: We respect your chosen daily reminder times to send local notifications.  
- **Improve the App**: Anonymous usage data helps us prioritize bug fixes, UI refinements, and new features.
- **Local Storage**: Your birth details are stored only on your device and are not transmitted to any servers.
- **Feature Development**: With your permission, we may use anonymized aspects of your birth details to develop or improve in‑app features (e.g., advanced rāga algorithms or personalized insights).

## 3. Data Storage & Security

- We **never** sell, rent, or share your personal birth details.  
- We share **only anonymized analytics events** with Google (via Firebase Analytics) to power aggregate insights.  
- Crash reports (errors) may be sent to Firebase Crashlytics to help us diagnose and fix issues.
